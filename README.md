## üìå Project Overview

**Smart Doctor** is a desktop-based disease prediction system developed using **Python** and **PyQt5** that leverages machine learning algorithms to predict possible diseases based on user-input symptoms. The system uses three major ML models ‚Äî Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest ‚Äî trained on a curated dataset of 40+ diseases and 100+ unique symptoms.

This project aims to reduce the cost and time of medical diagnosis by allowing users to get a preliminary prediction of potential diseases from their symptoms without immediately visiting a doctor. The user-friendly graphical interface makes it accessible even for non-technical users.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multiple Machine Learning Algorithms:**  
  Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest for improved prediction accuracy.

- **Extensive Disease Database:**  
  Over 40 diseases with 100+ symptoms including common illnesses like malaria, flu, diabetes, etc.

- **User-Friendly GUI:**  
  Built with PyQt5, simple symptom selection and disease prediction interface.

- **Voice Output:**  
  System can read out disease details using Windows SAPI.voice API.

- **Offline Functionality:**  
  Does not require internet connection after setup.

- **Excel-Based Dataset:**  
  Dataset stored in Excel format for easy modifications and updates.

## üéØ Objectives

- Provide a **cost-effective** tool for preliminary disease diagnosis.  
- Save users' **time** by predicting diseases based on symptoms.  
- Assist healthcare professionals with a quick symptom-based prediction tool.  
- Develop an **intuitive interface** usable by non-technical people.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system follows a modular architecture:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   Raw symptom and disease data from Excel is cleaned and formatted.

2. **Model Training:**  
   Three ML models are trained on the dataset ‚Äî Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

3. **GUI Interface:**  
   PyQt5-based interface allows users to enter their name, select symptoms, and get predictions.

4. **Prediction & Output:**  
   Models predict diseases based on selected symptoms; results with descriptions and precautions are displayed and optionally read aloud.
